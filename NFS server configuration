# NFS stand for network file system
# 1. before installing the nfs kernel serever we need to update our systems repository index so that we are able to install the latest version 
of a software through ubuntu repositories then install the NFS kerenel server

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install nfs-kerenel-server -y

# 2. create the export directory
# you can give it any name or a name instructed by the company
# -p allows you make a directory in a directory

sudo mkdir -p /mount/share/

# 3. to allow clients access the directory we need to remove all restrictive permissions

sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mount/share/
sudo chown 777 /mount/share/ 

# 4. assign server access to clients through nFS export file.
# use can put your vpc infront of the code meaning that anyone who has access to this vpc has access to the server or use wildcard (*)
#meaning anyone from anyone has access. the former is used in real work situations.
# only the vpc changes here.

sudo vi /etc/exports
172.31.0.0/16(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)

# 5. export the share directory

sudo exportfs -a 
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server 

# 6.
# open the firewall for clients
# edit inbound rules, look for nfs and port 2049 should automatically be open.

# 7.
configure your master and worker nodes by running the following command on all of them 

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install nfs-common -y
